# Investigate-Hotel-Business-using-Data-Visualization
I created visualizations and data storytelling to provide insights into hotel business performance by evaluating how clients book hotel tickets and identifying characteristics that affect hotel ticket cancellations. Additionally, I utilized data research and analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in customer behavior and hotel booking processes. Based on my analysis, I provided recommendations to the company to improve their customer acquisition, retention, and revenue.
